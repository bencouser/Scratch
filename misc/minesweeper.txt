How to do minesweeper:

> Get a grid of nxn squares
    - To implement this have an nxn array of zeros
    - place m number of bombs in the zeros
        - add 1 to all neighbour cells
        - use number in cell to determine what graphic should be rendered
        - a bomb == 9
        - 9 + 1 = 9

> Can we get away with only rerendering the cells that is clicked/effected by the click?
    - How to get position of click on window.
    - Initialise screen by rendering each tile unclicked.
    - Also run ./grid to initialise gameplay
    - when cell is clicked
        - Check if cell has already been clicked
        - End game if it is a bomb
        - Need to make an algorithm to work out which cells are revealed.
